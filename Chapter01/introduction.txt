D3 is a javascript library for manipulating Data Object Model (DOM)
tree in order to represent information visualy.
In order to explore this project you should be familiar with:
- SVGs [XML]
- JavaScript Basics
- CSS
- HTML5

Each example is based from the Book "D3 for the Impatient"
I added a few "quirks" of my own.
Ultimately each example follows the book chapter by chapter.

I tried to make the tutorial as interactive as possible.
That being said make sure to use those features for a better experience.
